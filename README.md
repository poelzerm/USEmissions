# Political Affiliation and CO₂ Emissions

This small independent project explores the relationship between political affiliation of U.S. states and their per capita CO₂ emissions, inspired by sustainability research and data from the EIA and FEC.

## Highlights:
- Found a negative correlation (-0.53) between Democratic leaning and emissions.
- Visualized trends from 1996–2020.
- Cited supporting research, e.g., Pew Research Center and Dhruv Aggarwal.

## Tools Used:
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

This was a side project in 2025, and while not a full research paper, it reflects my interest in climate data and policy.
